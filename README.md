# Node Intro

To run most of these basic examples, open a terminal window and type

```
node <file-name>
```

Some of the examples will terminate when they have finished. Others will
require you to type Ctl-C to force-terminate the application.

The `15-express-server` and `server.js` can be started similarly, but
they start a small web server that you can exercise from your browser at the
domain http://localhost:3004. See the comments in the files for what
url paths are implemented and what they do.
